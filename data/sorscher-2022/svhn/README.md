Data taken from scaling_laws_empirics.pdf of https://arxiv.org/e-print/2206.14486.

Plots were first cleaned up using inkscape to remove overlays that blocked points.

Plots were then parsed using https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/.
The data is parsed as wpd.json.

The cleaned version of the data is given in `wpd-clean.csv`.
Cleaning was done manually.
